Does machine processing power affect execution time?
Yes, processing power affects execution time, but algorithm complexity plays a more significant role.

Which performs better: std::list or std::vector?
std::vector generally performs better for smaller N, but std::list can be more efficient for frequent deletions.

How does N impact runtime compared to M?
Increasing N increases the number of elimination steps.
Larger M results in fewer eliminations per cycle, affecting runtime.
